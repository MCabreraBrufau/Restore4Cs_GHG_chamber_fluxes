# Restore4Cs_GHG_chamber_fluxes
This repository contains code used to calculate instantaneous GHG fluxes from RData GHG concentration timeseries and auxfiles for CO2 and CH4. 
Running the script 'Fluxes_from_RData.R' produces a csv file for each GHG species, with three flux estimates for each incubation , alongside incubation-level plots (optional). 
Running the script 'Best_model_selection.R' produces a csv file per GHG species, with the selection of which flux estimate is most-appropriate.
